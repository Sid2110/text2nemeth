TODO:
(1) Add more english in the language files (See Bookmarks)

(2) Better detection of mathematics in detectLanguage     (If Math is detected, then use the English Characters for language, and the Greek within the Nemeth code - Not from the Language File)

(3) Implement the Nemeth Code and the Universal math system

(4) mathml2variable population   (Might not be needed. Probably last thing to do)

(5) support for mixed numbers in Nemeth           (Find out a way... - One might be to have a number just before the fraction, but it isn't always true)

(6) Implement a Page-matrix which will show the relative position of translated braille. See hypercomplex fraction on the link on TODO(6)


NOTES:
1- Do the conversion of the math variables before the specialCharacter variables
2- Each time, set the indicators within the math module so that we know the language we are at.
3- Funny stuff happen to MathML conversion of this expression: 1/(2/a_b) (Which is why the `asciimathml` dependency will be dropped)
