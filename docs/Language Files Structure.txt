 > The language files are simple Python scripts that only hold data. (No functions are used)


 > The Braille representation that is used throughout the program:
    The example Braille Cell:
    [a,d]
    [b,e]
    [c,f]
    can be represented as the string: `abcdef` with 1 being a dot, and 0 being an empty space. Like this: '100010'
(See the included language files, for example)


 > The variables consist of the following:
    - alphabet: (type: dict) Representation of the alphabet in the format discussed above. This includes shorthands of letter combinations such as `sh`, `th` etc...
        Note: > prefixes end with a dash (e.g. 'be-')
              > suffixes start with a dash (e.g. '-ing')
              > infixes letter combinations start and end with a dash (e.g. '-ea-')
              > if there are also intonated letters (like ά in Greek), include them as well

    - contractions: (type: dict) Some words in Braille have simpler representations. For example, the word `child` in English can be represented as `ch` in Braille.

    - specialCharacters: (type: dict) Each language has special characters. Some may be the same in every language. Therefore, this list includes all these special characters, and their Braille representation. There are some variables you may use which are discussed below.


 > Variables in the Formatting:
    - General Info:
        Each variable starts with a dollar sign `$` or a percent sign `%`. That is because there are two types of variables:
            1) The percent sign variables indicate that the variable is used as a shift-sign/indicator. For example, to make a letter capital, it needs the shift indicator '000001' before the letter. This is where the %capital command is used. These are automatically determined by the system.

            2) The dollar sign variables indicate a normal variable. For instance, the dollar sign cannot be represented as '$' because it is used already for the variables. This means that we need to use the $dollar variable to represent it. If they are used within the input text, they will be replaced accordingly. (The $dollar, $quote_open and $quote_close are automatically detected.)

        IMPORTANT: Please implement the indicators in the language file. Otherwise, the correct behaviour of the translator is not guaranteed.

    - List of Variables:
        -- Indicators:
          %capital        : This indicates that the next letter needs to be a capital letter
          %number         : The next letter is a number
          %letter         : Force end a series of numbers. (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Braille#Formatting_marks)
          %foreign_indicator  : The next letter is in different language (e.g. used for non-Latin characters) - Usually it is the Double Passage indicator
          %foreign_capital    : Some languages have different capital indicators for foreign languages.

        -- Other Variables:
          $dollar         : Represent a dollar sign
          $quote_open     : Represent an opening quote (“)
          $quote_close    : Represent a closing quote (”)
          $single_quote_open     : Represent a single opening quote (')
          $single_quote_close    : Represent a single closing quote (')
          $shape          : The next word is a shape (circle, triangle etc...)
          $emph           : Gives emphasis to the following letter
          $underline      : Underlined text
          $accent         : Declares a diacritic to the following letter (See explanation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Braille#Alphabet)

                (For Mathematics:)
          $decimal        : Represents the decimal point in mathematic notation
          $comma          : Represents the comma separator in mathematic notation
          $triple_dot     : Represents ...
          $sqrt           : Represents the square root sign

 > Misc Notes:
    1) The only built-in data is numbers.
    2) To disable a specific language file from being imported, then change the do_not_import variable to True
    3) You can change the numbering system from Nemeth to Standard by having the use_nemeth_code to False
